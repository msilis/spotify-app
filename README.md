# spotify-app

This was a project in the [Codecademy] (http://www.codecademy.com) Front-end Developer track. This uses React to build an app that talks to the Spotify API and creates new playlists in a user's account from searches done in the app. 

Because of the age of the project in the course, it still used classes instead of hooks to manage things like state and make components. It was good to be able to work through bugs in this older style of React and be a bit more hands on in how things worked.
